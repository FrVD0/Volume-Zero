            Detective Basil Mustardseed wasn’t a typical private investigator. For one thing, he lived in a filing cabinet. Not inside it in the traditional sense, but <em>as</em> it—his soul, if one could call it that, suffused its drawers and metal frame. Most days, this peculiar arrangement was no hindrance. In fact, it was an advantage. Every case file, witness report, and evidence bag was right where he needed it: within himself.
        </p>
        <p>
            That Tuesday, however, something was wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Inspector!" cried Ms. Verbena Fig, his loyal assistant and sole tenant of the office where he resided. "Something’s missing!"
        </p>
        <p>
            “Calm yourself,” Basil said, his voice a warm hum that emanated from the bottom drawer. “What seems to be the issue?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “It’s… it’s the nouns, sir. They’re gone!” Ms. Fig thrust a newspaper toward the cabinet. The headline read: <em>Local __ Found Near __ at Midnight; Suspects Flee in __.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Basil froze, which was impressive for a being that lacked limbs or temperature. He scanned the document. The nouns weren’t just erased—they’d vanished from the <em>conceptual space</em>. No one could remember what had been found, where it had been discovered, or how the suspects had escaped.
        </p>
<p>
“This is sabotage,” Basil muttered. “Some vile force seeks to dismantle communication itself.”
</p>
<p>
*
</p>
<p>
The first suspect was a verb, lanky and jittery, pacing back and forth in the small, lamp-lit room of Basil’s top drawer.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t do nothing!” the verb protested. “I’ve been too busy conjugatin’. You can check my records!”
</p>
<p>
“I already have,” Basil replied, his tone as sharp as a paper cut. “But you’re the most mobile of the parts of speech. Who better to smuggle nouns out of town?”
</p>
<p>
The verb trembled but held its ground.
</p>
<p>
“Fine,” Basil conceded. “You’re dismissed…for now. Send in the conjunctions.”
</p>
<p>
The conjunctions arrived as a group, of course, holding hands. “We’re and, but, and or,” they said in unison. “We didn’t see anything!”
</p>
<p>
“Convenient,” Basil said. “But if you didn’t see anything, how do you explain the strange lack of nouns in your recent correspondence? You’ve been…disjointed.”
<p>
They shuffled uncomfortably, avoiding his glare.
</p>
<p>
**
</p>
<p>
Hours later, Ms. Fig burst into the office, holding a translucent, shimmering figure in her hands. “I caught it, sir! It’s a preposition!”
</p>
<p>
“A preposition?” Basil exclaimed. “But why?”
</p>
<p>
The preposition cackled. “Because I’ve always been beneath the nouns, around them, alongside them! Never in the spotlight. Always supporting, never supported! So I whispered to the ellipses, and together, we erased them. 
</p>
<p>
Now the sentence is mine!”
</p>
<p>
* * *
</p>
<p>
With a clever trick—deploying a semicolon as bait—Basil and Ms. Fig lured the nouns back from the void. Order was restored, though Basil noted a peculiar quiet in the filing cabinet for days after.
</p>
<p>
“Well done, Ms. Fig,” he said eventually. “One can only wonder what havoc the exclamation marks might try next.”
</p>
<p>
Ms. Fig chuckled, placing a fresh sheet of paper in the typewriter.“Another day, another mystery, Inspector.”
</p>
<p>
And with that, the nouns—and the universe—were safe once more.
